# Description

This project aims to model an information system that describes the core functionalities of a music streaming platform, 
inspired by modern on-demand music services such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music. 

The system includes features ranging from browsing a music catalog and listening to tracks, to personalized music management 
through playlist creation. 

# Objectives

The main goal of this project is to design a database to support the core functionalities of a music streaming platform. 
Specifically, the system will enable:
- management of a catalog of songs, albums, artists, and music genres;
- tracking of users who access the platform;
- monitoring of user activities, including the creation of personal playlists;
- organizing and tracking relationships between users and the artists they follow;
- linking each track to a specific album and genre, while maintaining the connection to the performing artist(s);
- monitoring the number of track plays as a potential metric of popularity;
- supporting searches and queries that allow filtering content by genre, artist, or number of plays.

This data structure can later be extended and integrated with more advanced tools to offer features such as personalized song recommendations, 
analysis of musical preferences, or automatic playlist generation based on explicit or implicit user tastesâ€”paving the way for the integration of artificial intelligence modules.
